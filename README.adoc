Getting started with rust 2021 edition by Carlo Milanesi 
(personal notes). 

== Getting Started 

[source, rust]
----
fn main(){
    println!("Hey there!");
}
----

== Doing Arithmetic and Writing More Code 

[source, rust]
----
println!("The sum is {}", 52.2+63.58);
----

== Naming Objects 

[source, rust]
----
let this = 3; // cannot be changed 
let mut that = 5; //can be changed 

let _num = 7 // will not warn you in case _num is never used 
let _ = 7 // you don't want to specify any name (not a valid expression)
----

* The type of a variable can be deduced or inferred from the expression used to initialize it.

[source, rust]
----
let mut num; // compiler cannot assign a datatype
let mut num = 6; //compiler understands: this will always be an int
----

* By default, Rust includes the standard library. 

[source, rust]
----
println!("There're {} words in the word two.", "two".len()); // or:
println!("There're {} words in the word three.", str::len("three"));
----

== Controlling Execution Flow 

=== if-else 

[source, rust]
----
fn main() {
    let n:i32 = -4;

    if n <= 5 && n>0 {println!("Num is less than 5");}
    else if n <= 10 && n >5 {println!("Num is less than 10");}
    else {println!("Num is not within range");}
}
----

[source, rust]
----
fn main() {
    let n:i32 = 5;
    println!("{}",
        if n <= 5 && n>0 {"Num is less than 5"}
        else if n <= 10 && n >5 {"Num is less than 10"}
        else {"Num is not within range"}
    )
}
----

* In Rust, `if` can be used as a _statement_ and as an _expression_.
